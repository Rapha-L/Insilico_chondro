The type I receptors, also termed activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs), act downstream of type II receptors and determine receptor specificity. The canonical signalling route of TGFβ is via the broadly expressed type I receptor ALK5, but in chondrocytes and other cell types additional ALKs, such as ALK1, can be involved","","",

Through sequential changes in interaction and phosphorylation status of these proteins, phosphorylation of the amino-terminal domain of β-catenin is disturbed, leading to stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. The nuclear-translocated β-catenin stimulates transcription of the target genes with co-transcription factors such as T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) family","","",
